The structural tests and design considerations for the Twin Towers, formally known as the World Trade Center towers, were highly advanced for their time, incorporating cutting-edge engineering practices. Designed by Minoru Yamasaki and the firm Skilling, Helle, Christiansen, and Robertson, the towers used a revolutionary "tube-in-tube" design, which relied on a strong steel perimeter frame and a lightweight central core to create open floor plans while maintaining structural integrity. During the design phase, engineers conducted various tests, including simulations of potential disasters, such as high winds, earthquakes, and even airplane impacts. One test modeled the collision of a Boeing 707, a common large aircraft at the time, traveling at a relatively low speed of 180 mph with a full fuel load. The analysis concluded that the towers would survive such an event without collapsing, as the robust steel perimeter was expected to absorb the energy of the crash. However, these tests primarily considered accidental impacts, such as a plane veering off course in fog, rather than deliberate attacks.

This prior analysis inadvertently inspired the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks. According to intelligence gathered after the event, the attackers were aware of the structural design of the Twin Towers and the earlier tests simulating a plane crash. Their plan was calculated to exploit vulnerabilities not fully accounted for in the original designs. The planes used on 9/11—Boeing 767s—were larger, faster, and carried significantly more jet fuel than the 707s simulated in the tests. Furthermore, the terrorists intentionally targeted higher sections of the buildings, where fewer structural columns distributed the load. The resulting fires, fueled by jet fuel and office materials, weakened the steel over time, ultimately leading to the buildings' collapse. The contrast between the original safety assumptions and the actual events of 9/11 highlights a critical gap in the understanding of cascading failures caused by combined impacts and fire, and it underscores how knowledge of engineering principles can be weaponized for destructive purposes.
